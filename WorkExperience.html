        <center><h2><u>Primary School</u></h2></center>
        
            <center><p>In fourth year of secondary school I went on a week of work experience in the primary school I attended.</p></center>
            <center><p>Everyday I had different tasks I had to carry out like correcting homework and photocopying activity sheets.</p></center>
            <center><p>I spent two days in the lower classes and the last three days in the classroom with 5th and 6th class.</p></center>
            <center><p>I really enjoyed the week I spent there with the kids and with my past teachers.</p></center>
        <br>
        <center><h2><u>Aquarium</u></h2></center>
        
            <center><p>While in fourth year in secondary school I spent five days in the aquarium during the halloween break.</p><center>
            <center><p>These few days of work experience were a lot different than the time I spent in the primary school.</p></center>
            <center><p>It was different in the way that I  felt I was part of the work force. I had daily tasks I had to complete.</p></center>
            <center><p>My tasks included feeding the fish and cleaning out the tanks.</p></center>
        <br>
        <center><h2><u>Kids Club Assistant</u></h2></center>
        
        <center><p>Towards the beginning of fifth year in secondary school I started working in a hotel in my local area in a kids club.</p></center>
        <center><p>I work in the kids club currently. I work during the weekends and during primary school holidays like summer and</p></center>
        <center><p>christmas break. I take care of the children during their stay in the hotel. My fellow colleagues and I play games</p></center>
        <center><p>and do activities with the children.</p></center>
